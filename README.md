# sd-webui-samplers-scheduler

## Introduce
A samplers scheduler which can apply different sampler in diffrent generation steps,  

I hope it will be benefit to achieve a balance between generation speed and image quality.

## Requirement
sd webui Version <= 1.5.2  

## How to use
This repository is a extension for sd webui. Just use it as a sd extension!ðŸ˜‰  

Choose the Sampler Seniorious or Seniorious Karras to enable the samplers scheduler.  

*Seniorious uses nomal noise scheduler and Seniorious Karras uses the noise scheduler  
recommended in [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) (Karras et al., 2022)

This samplers scheduler provides 8 sampler units (Sampler 1-8). 

You can choose what kind of sampler used in each unit(choose `None` to unable), and the inference steps for each unit.  

The image generation process will follow the configurations of these 8 units in sequence. 

**Attention: The total steps should be equal to the sum of the steps in every unit!**

## Available Samplers
12 kinds of mainstream samplers are available:  

- `Euler`
- `Euler a`
- `Heun`
- `Heun++` (my improved version)
- `LMS`
- `DPM2`
- `DPM2 a`
- `DPM++ 2S a`
- `DPM++ SDE`
- `DPM++ 2M`
- `DPM++ 2M SDE`
- `DPM++ 3M SDE`

You can also choose `Skip` to skip certain steps.

## Example

Sampler Scheduler Parameters:  
| Unit | Sampler | Steps |
| :-----:| :----: | :----: |
| Sampler1 | Heun | 10 steps |
| Sampler2 | DPM++2M | 10 steps |
| Sampler3 | Euler | 10 steps |  

*Seniorious and Seniorious Karras use the same parameters in this example


## More
The idea of this extension was inspired by Seniorious, a Carillon composed of different talismans.  

Different talismans correspond in sequence to make Seniorious a powerful weapon, and so do the samplers in the samplers scheduler.  

In the end, many thanks to Chtholly Nota Seniorious, the happiest girl in the world.
