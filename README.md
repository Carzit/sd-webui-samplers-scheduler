# sd-webui-samplers-scheduler

## Introduce
a samplers scheduler which can apply different sampler in diffrent generation steps,  

which I hope will be benefit to achieve a balance between generation speed and image quality

## How to use
This repository is a extension for sd webui. Just use it as a sd extension!ðŸ˜‰  

Choose the Sampler Seniorious to enable the samplers scheduler

This samplers scheduler provides 8 sampler units (Sampler1-8) 

You can choose what kind of sampler used in each unit(choose None to unable), and the inference steps for each unit.  

The image generation process will follow the configurations of these 8 units in sequence.
