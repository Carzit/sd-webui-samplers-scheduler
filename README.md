# sd-webui-samplers-scheduler Seniorious

## Introduce
A samplers scheduler which can apply different sampler in diffrent generation steps,  

I hope it will be helpful to achieve a balance between generation speed and image quality.

Our paper on arXiv: [Sampler Scheduler for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06845)  

## Requirement
SD WebUI Version <= 1.5.2  

## How to use
This repository is a extension for sd webui. Just place it in the `extension` folder!ðŸ˜‰  

Choose the Sampler `Seniorious` or `Seniorious Karras` to enable the samplers scheduler.  

*`Seniorious` uses nomal noise scheduler and `Seniorious Karras` uses the noise scheduler  
recommended in [Elucidating the Design Space of Diffusion-Based Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.00364) (Karras et al., 2022)

This samplers scheduler provides 8 sampler units (Sampler 1-8). 

You can choose what kind of sampler used in each unit(choose `None` to unable), and the inference steps for each unit.  

The image generation process will follow the configurations of these 8 units in sequence. 

**Attention: The total steps should be equal to the sum of the steps in every unit!**

## Available Samplers
12 kinds of mainstream samplers in [k-diffusion](https://github.com/crowsonkb/k-diffusion) are available:  

- `Euler`
- `Euler a`
- `Heun`
- `Heun++` (my improved version)
- `LMS`
- `DPM2`
- `DPM2 a`
- `DPM++ 2S a`
- `DPM++ SDE`
- `DPM++ 2M`
- `DPM++ 2M SDE`
- `DPM++ 3M SDE`

You can also choose `Skip` to skip certain steps.

## FID Result
I calculate the FID Score based on [EDM](https://github.com/NVlabs/edm).

- seeds=0-49999

- NFE=36
  
| Sampler | FID |
| :-----: | :----: |
| Euler[36] | 3.66024 | 
| Heun[18] | 7.02495 |  
| Heun[9]Euler[18] | 4.60633 | 
| Heun[12]DPM++2M[12] | 2.16356 |  

Discretely scheduling different samplers during the sampling process has proven to be effective at a practical level.

## More
The idea of this extension was inspired by Seniorious, a Carillon composed of different talismans.  

Different talismans correspond in sequence to make Seniorious a powerful weapon, and so do the samplers in the samplers scheduler.  

In the end, many thanks to Chtholly Nota Seniorious, the happiest girl in the world.
